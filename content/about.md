Hey!

I'm Riha! You might know me as Hari/Harikrishnan.

I am a part anthropologist, part systems thinker, and full-time translator between people, data, and decisions. My journey in technology is driven by curiosity and a love for solving complex problems with data.

I study the human side of systems: how organizations make meaning from information, how teams use (or ignore) data, and how decisions ripple through real-world outcomes. My approach blends data science, anthropology, and systems thinking to build tools that serve both insight and empathy.

[I’ve worked across corporate, startup, and non-profit ecosystems, designing data systems that adapt to each context]() — from fast-paced innovation labs to grounded field programs. This breadth helps me translate across worlds: tech and operations, business and impact, boardrooms and grassroots.

In every setting, my goal is the same — to make data human, useful, and quietly powerful.
